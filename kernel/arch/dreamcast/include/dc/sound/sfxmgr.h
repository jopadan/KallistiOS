/** \file    dc/sound/sfxmgr.h
    \brief   Basic sound effect support.
    \ingroup audio_sfx

    This file contains declarations for doing simple sound effects. This code is
    only usable for simple WAV files containing either 8-bit or 16-bit samples (stereo
    or mono) or Yamaha ADPCM (4-bits, stereo or mono). Also, all sounds played in
    this manner must be at most 65534 samples in length, as this does not handle
    buffer chaining or anything else complex. For more interesting stuff, you
    should probably look at the sound stream stuff instead.
